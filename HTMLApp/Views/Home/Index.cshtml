<h1>The Statue of Liberty</h1>
<p>The Statue of Liberty was built over nine years by French sculpture Auguste Bartholdi.<br>
   Upon its completion in1884 all 350 individual pieces of the statue were packed into <br> 214 crates
   for the long boat ride from France to New York</p>

<hr />

<p>The statue arrived in America several months later and was reconstructed on <br>Liberty Island.
   Auguste Bartholdi thought that the New York harbour was the perfect <br> setting for his masterpiece 
   because it was where immigrants gor their first view of <br> the New World</p>
